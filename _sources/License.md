## External code used

Additionally, some files and functionality draw from existing open-source code, as described below.

(1) A file (gpuarray.h) is based on a part of the HOOMD-blue project, released
under the BSD 3-Clause License. (similar ideas for classes that simultaneously handle cpu and GPU array data
structures have also appeared elsewhere; the hoomd version is the file I started modifying, though)
