# Python interface

As an alternative to the command-line and GUI interfaces, Python scripts are available in the *tools/* directory for use with other scripts or within Jupyter notebooks: 

* For setting up boundaries: *tools/boundaryHelper.py*
* For setting up initial conditions: *tools/initHelper.py*
* For running openQmin: *tools/runHelper.py* 

In this section we'll demonstrate the usage of these scripts.
