# Python interface

As an alternative to the command-line and GUI interfaces, Python scripts are available in the *tools/* directory for use with other scripts or within Jupyter notebooks: 

* For setting up boundaries: *tools/boundaryHelper.py*
* For setting up initial conditions: *tools/initHelper.py*
<<<<<<< HEAD
* For generating the command-line call to openQmin: *tools/runHelper.py* 

Here we'll demonstrate the usage of these scripts. 

To visualize results, we'll use [openViewMin](https://gitlab.com/d.a.beller/openviewmin), a visualization environment under development for use with openQmin. This project is not yet publicly available, so if you want to help test it out, please contact Daniel Beller at d.a.beller \[at\] jhu.edu.

* For running openQmin: *tools/runHelper.py* 

In this section we'll demonstrate the usage of these scripts.
