    "## Overview \n",
    "\n",
    "[Open-Qmin](https://github.com/sussmanLab/open-Qmin.git) is an open-source code base for numerical modeling of nematic liquid crystals and their topological defects at equilibrium, by relaxation of a finite-difference lattice discretization of the Landau-de Gennes free energy. This project aims to be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fast:** Allows utilization of GPU or CPU resources, and uses efficient minimization routines like the Fast Inertial Relaxation Engine (FIRE).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scalable:** Automates MPI parallelization, allowing users to exploit as many CPU cores as they have available in order to access supra-micron scales often closer to experimental dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Customizable:** Users can specify boundary conditions, external fields, and material properties, usually without requiring recompilation. Common boundaries like planar walls or colloidal inclusions can be added with provided recipes; or users can define custom boundary geometries site-by-site.\n",
    "\n",
    "A [peer-reviewed article in *Frontiers in Physics*](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphy.2019.00204/full) describes open-Qmin's theoretical approach, numerical implementation, and basic usage. Some information is more up-to-date in the documentation you're reading here."

    "A Python-based 3D visualization environment called \"openViewMin\" is under development as a visualization companion to open-Qmin. It will supersede the visualization routines described in the *Frontiers in Physics* article. This documentation will make use of open-ViewMin to examine example results from open-Qmin simulations. "
